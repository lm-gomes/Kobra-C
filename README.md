# Kobra-C
Kobra is a C terminal game based on the classic snake game.

I really like playing videogames, and these days i was wanting to get back to my C studies, and that's when i thought: Why not to make a game in C? And why not the classic game where a snake have to eat things and cannot hit it's body or the walls?

KOBRA is as simple as possible: It only uses ASCII characteres to represent the graphics, some 8-bit audios and 3 colors. That's all!

## Libraries:
  ### ncurses
    used for keypad detection, window, colors, and all the graphics
  ### SDL2_mixer
    used for sounds... yead, that's it
